// After each step, git add . AND git commit -m "completed part PART-LETTER-HERE"
// Complete all four steps specified below - each step needs a console.log statement.
// EXAMPLE - Try running node starter.js before working on any of the parts and see what happens in the terminal.

/********************************
 *
 * STEP A: Strings
 *
 *********************************/

// Set a constant equal to the name of our SEI instance (capitalized) with the name 'bestClass'.  Log this value.

// Set a bestClassLowercase variable converting bestClass to a lowercase string. Log this value.

/********************************
 *
 * STEP B: Total
 *
 *********************************/

const amount1 = 1;
const amount2 = 3;

// Write an expression here which computes
// the correct value of a constant "total" based on the values of a and b

// Log your answer (the value of total) to the console

/********************************
 *
 * STEP C: Basic Conversion
 *
 *********************************/

const pounds = 155;

// Write an expression here which computes
// the correct value of a variable "kilograms"

// Log kilograms to the console

/********************************
 *
 * STEP D: Grand Hotel Tremezzo
 *
 *********************************/

// Create a variable grandHotelTremezzoGuests that is equal to an array containing three strings:
// 'George Clooney' 'Silvio Berlusconi'  and 'Isabella Rossellini'. Log grandHotelTremezzoGuests.

// A new guest is checking in! Add "Fabio" to the end of the array. Log grandHotelTremezzoGuests.

// False alarm! Fabio was on a roller coaster and got hit in the face with a pigeon 
// so he won't be able to stay at the hotel remove him from the end of the array.  
// (We didn't use this method in class you will have to research.)  Log grandHotelTremezzoGuests.

// A new guest is checking in for real! Add 'Mario Batali' to the end of our array. 
// He is wearing a disguise...but orange crocs. Log grandHotelTremezzoGuests.

// Another new guest is checking in for real! Add 'Mario Balotelli' to the end of our array. 
// Log grandHotelTremezzoGuests.

// Create a variable that is equal to the number of guests staying in our hotel by 
// checking the items count of grandHotelTremezzoGuests array.  Log this.

// Create a variable 'grandHotelTremezzoPastGuests' set to an empty Array.

// George Clooney had a scooter accident so has to check out.  
// Remove him from our array of guests.  Use both the splice method 
// and the push method to add his name to 'grandHotelTremezzoPastGuests' 
// while simultaneously removing him from grandHotelTremezzoGuests. 
// Log both grandHotelTremezzoGuests and grandHotelTremezzoPastGuests in the same log statement.

// ***Re-assign*** the variable that is equal to the number of guests staying 
// in our hotel by checking the items count of grandHotelTremezzoGuests array.  
// (Don't create a new variable)  Log this.

// The hotel is going to deliver a bottle of Nero de Como to each guest. 
// Use a for loop to log out '*Silvio Berlusconi* gets a bottle of Nero de Como' for each guest.

// The guests drank their bottles of Nero de Como and are getting rowdy. 
// Tell them to be quiet by using a for loop to say ... '*Silvio Berlusconi* please hush up!!!'

// Create an empty array sleepingGuests

// The guests passed out. Loop over the guests and add them to the sleepingGuests array.  
// (Don't remove them from grandHotelTremezzoGuests.) Log out sleepingGuests.

// Lake Como has started to flood so all of the guests are fleeing to Milan. 
// Use splice to remove all of the guests (simultaneously using push to add them 
// to the array of checked out guests). Log both grandHotelTremezzoGuests 
// and grandHotelTremezzoPastGuests in the same log statement.

// Create a variable isGrandHotelTremezzoEmpty to be equal to a 
// boolean with the appropriate value (it is empty). Log this variable.
